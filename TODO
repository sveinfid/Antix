- scoring

- optimize:
	- last_x/last_y from node to client every time not necessary
	- some data sent between nodes unnecessary:
		- seen / foreign messages can probably be pruned (team, id)
	- Optimize remove_puck() in map? Goes through vector currently


- put back in sensing using foreign robots/pucks. Currently they are ignored
	- foreign pucks have been ignored the whole time, but we used to deal with foreign robots prior to grid
- foreign puck pickup

- improve collisions issue re: when robot moves into node, may move into occupied cell. currently just doesn't get in a cell
