- make able to run multiple nodes on single machine while not increasing the number of client processes on that machine
- replace Robots vector with map<team, Robot>. this makes find_robot() faster, and we always need easy access to all robots anyway due to needing to build GUI map
	- probably can entirely remove vector<Puck *> pucks. No real need? GUI perhaps...
	- but for GUI we could just go through every cell. that may be markedly slower however
- put back in sensing using foreign robots/pucks. Currently they are ignored
	- foreign pucks have been ignored the whole time, but we used to deal with foreign robots prior to grid
- make building of border entities (those close to border) use the grid instead of the vector
- likewise with building move entities (those that are out of range and need to be moved)
- scoring
- collisions
